        Program="Corporate Headquarters"
        Description="Located in one of the tallest buildings in the region, the 360-degree views afforded from the top levels of this building were the driver in its adaptive reuse as a national headquarters in Rosslyn, Virginia. Prospects directly across the river to the National Mall and the Georgetown neighborhood in Washington DC were the drivers in the design. The scope involved the renovation of the top level of the building to provide meeting and amenity spaces. The innovative architectural concept uses a series of outwardly focused spaces - a 'room necklace' that provides variously scaled rooms, including a cafÃ© space for employees. The design embraces natural materials and plantings to integrate nature into the daily experience of employees while also permitting special events and meetings."
