        Description="The focus of this redevelopment project was implementing a mid-block public passage as part of a master plan that links the neighborhood to the adjacent transit center. The building forms are designed to maximize natural light along this public passage and scale the buildings appropriately. An undulating, wrinkled faÃ§ade plane allows for outdoor balconies to be inset into the majority of residences. Green plantings enhance the public realm and are incorporated into the balconies."
