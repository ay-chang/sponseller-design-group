        Description="The redevelopment of this site references the legacy of the historic Greenbelt Town Center planned during the public works era in the 1930â€™s. The plan converts a suburban office park and puts the pedestrian and public realm at the center of its densification. A combination of uses is added to the existing office buildings including office, residential, hotel and retail. The plan is street focused and integrates pedestrians and vehicles in a network of streets, green spaces, gardens, and parks."
